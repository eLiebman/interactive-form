# interactive-form

This form provides feedback to the user as they interact with it. It includes the most common HTML form elements, and
provides warning messages as the user types that turn red upon submission, if the input is still invalid.
The starting HTML and CSS were provided by TeamTreeHouse. All Javascript, and any warning-related CSS and HTML was written by me.
